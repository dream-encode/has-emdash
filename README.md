## 🎭 About

Welcome to **The Em Dash Oracle**, the world's most scientifically dubious yet aesthetically pleasing method for detecting AI-generated content. Based on the groundbreaking observation that artificial intelligence has an inexplicable fondness for em dashes (—), this tool provides instant analysis of any webpage's authenticity.

### The Science™

Our proprietary algorithm employs advanced punctuation pattern recognition to determine the probability of AI authorship:

- **Em dashes detected**: 100% AI-generated content probability
- **No em dashes found**: 0% AI-generated content probability

*Results are guaranteed to be either completely accurate or entirely wrong.*

## ✨ Features

- 🔮 **Mystical Interface**: Consult the punctuation spirits through our elegant glass-morphism design
- 📊 **Instant Analysis**: Get immediate results with sophisticated academic language
- 🎨 **Whimsical Design**: Beautiful gradient backgrounds and smooth animations
- 📱 **Responsive**: Works on all devices (em dashes detected equally on mobile and desktop)
- 🧠 **High-Brow Humor**: For those who appreciate the finer things in punctuation

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- A sense of humor about AI detection methods

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/em-dash-oracle.git
cd em-dash-oracle
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

5. Begin your journey into punctuation-based AI detection!

## 🎯 Usage

1. **Enter a URL** in the sophisticated input field
2. **Click "Divine"** to consult the punctuation spirits
3. **Await the verdict** as our advanced algorithms analyze the content
4. **Receive your results** with detailed analysis and recommendations

### Example Results

**AI Detected:**
```
Probability of AI-Generated Content: 100%

Verdict: Highly suspicious! This content contains 3 em dashes, 
a telltale sign of artificial intelligence attempting to appear sophisticated.

Detailed Analysis:
• Em dashes detected: 3
• Sophistication level: Artificially elevated
• Human probability: Negligible
• Recommendation: Approach with skepticism
```

**Human Detected:**
```
Probability of AI-Generated Content: 0%

Verdict: Refreshingly human! No em dashes detected. 
This content appears to be written by a genuine human being with normal punctuation habits.

Detailed Analysis:
• Em dashes detected: 0
• Sophistication level: Appropriately modest
• Human probability: Extremely high
• Recommendation: Safe to read without existential dread
```

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Built With

- **Vite** - Lightning fast build tool
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - No frameworks needed for this level of sophistication
- **CSS3** - With custom properties and glass-morphism effects
- **HTML5** - Semantic markup for the discerning developer

### Architecture

The application follows a simple yet elegant architecture:

```
src/
├── main.js          # Core application logic and DOM manipulation
├── style.css        # Whimsical styling with CSS custom properties
└── assets/          # Static assets (if any)
```

### Key Functions

- `analyzeContent()` - The heart of our em dash detection algorithm
- `fetchPageContent()` - Simulates content fetching (CORS-friendly demo mode)
- `showResults()` - Presents findings with appropriate gravitas
- `consultPunctuationSpirits()` - Just kidding, that's the loading function

## 🎨 Customization

### Styling

The application uses CSS custom properties for easy theming:

```css
:root {
  --primary-color: #2c3e50;
  --accent-color: #e74c3c;
  --success-color: #27ae60;
  /* ... more variables */
}
```

### Sample Texts

Modify the `sampleTexts` array in `main.js` to add your own demo content:

```javascript
const sampleTexts = [
  "Your custom text with an em dash — for testing purposes.",
  "Another example without the forbidden punctuation mark.",
  // Add more samples here
];
```

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome contributions to improve our punctuation-based AI detection methodology! Please feel free to:

- Report bugs (especially em dash false positives)
- Suggest new features (perhaps semicolon analysis?)
- Submit pull requests
- Share your own AI detection theories

### Development Guidelines

1. Maintain the whimsical tone in all documentation
2. Ensure responsive design across devices
3. Keep the core algorithm simple (it's a meme site, after all)
4. Add appropriate hover effects and animations
